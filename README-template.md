### Built with

-  HTML5 
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

i learnt how to add a favicon to my project since this is my first time using it

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<img>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.



### Continued development


I want to focuse on media query, CSS transition since am not so good.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me for lots of reasons when im lost in a code or i need help . I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
